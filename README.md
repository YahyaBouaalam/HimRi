## Improvements

Although I am proud of this personal project, there are still points that need to be implemented or retouched, as this project only represents a couple of weeks of work, where I was focused primarily on the functionality of the app and its backend and not much on the frontend of the app. Things that need further work include certain aspects of the design, as well as the animation, in addition to the functionality of the "I'm feeling lucky" button, which displays a random recipe while only taking into account the user's allergies.
